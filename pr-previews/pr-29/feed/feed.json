      "title": "Ways to replace apache.commons.configuration in your project",
      "content_html": "<p>If you’re using <em>apache.commons.configuration</em> to manage <em>.properties</em> files in your project, you’re probably facing the following problem:\n<em>Apache.commons.configuration</em> depends on <em>apache.common.logging</em> which is included in <em>maven:3.5</em>, but was removed from <em>maven:3.6</em>.\nThus, if you want to upgrade you will need to find a different way to parse your properties.</p>\n<p>Java offers the <em>java.util.Properties</em> class (see <a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/properties.html\">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/properties.html</a>), which is a subclass of <em>java.util.Hashtable</em>.\nIt maintains a list of keys and values, both are of type String, and provides methods for the following operations:\nLoading and saving the properties, getting a value by key, listing the keys and values, enumerating over the keys, and the methods inherited from the <em>Hashtable</em> class.</p>\n<h5><strong>But what if our data is complex?</strong></h5>\n<p>If we have nested properties <em>(i.e food.apple=red, food.icecream=vanilla, drink.milk=soy, drink.soft=coke)</em> how will we find all of the information about the main key (<em>food</em>, in this example)?\nIn order to retrieve the complete value we will need to iterate over the entire <em>Hashtable</em>, searching for all of the keys that contain <code>food.</code>.</p>\n<p>Here comes the biggest advantage of using <em>apache.commons.configuration</em>-\nIt offers a generic configuration interface to read data from a variety of sources, and access to single and multi-valued configuration parameters.</p>\n<p>When I started working on removing the dependency on <em>apache.commons.configuration</em>, I figured that since the properties we use are nested, I should see which methods of <em>apache.commons.configuration</em> we are actually using, and then I tried to mimic the original implementation. It was very tricky as I faced a whole chain of inheritance and interfaces to implement.\nAfter already putting some work into it, I decided to drop it all and go with a different approach. The main thing I had to handle was being able to set the nested properties properly.\nI decided to save the properties into a <em>HashMap</em> that stores <em>String</em> for the key, and <em>JsonNode</em> for the value.\nThat way I could set and get each property by its main key easily, and get the specific data of a specific secondary key if needed. For other operations I used the <em>HashMap’s</em> builtin methods.</p>\n<p>Here’s a snippet of my implementation for storing the data from the .properties file, where I used <code>com.fasterxml.jackson</code> for handling the JsonNode:</p>\n<pre><code>private void populateProperties(File file) throws IOException {\n    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\n    List lines = Files.readAllLines(file.toPath());\n    Map&lt;String, String&gt; allProps = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\n    for (String line: lines) {\n        if (line.contains(&quot;=&quot;)) {\n            allProps.put(line.split(&quot;=&quot;)[0], line.split(&quot;=&quot;)[1]);\n        }\n    }\n    allProps.forEach((k, v) -&gt; {\n        String[] mainKey = k.split(&quot;\\\\.&quot;);\n        if (this.props.get(mainKey[0]) != null) {\n            JsonNode oldNode = this.props.get(mainKey[0]);\n            ((ObjectNode) oldNode).put(mainKey[1], v);\n            this.props.put(mainKey[0], oldNode);\n        } else {\n            ObjectNode node = mapper.createObjectNode();\n            node.put(mainKey[1], v);\n            this.props.put(mainKey[0], node);\n        }\n    });\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>When choosing to use this implementation, we need to handle the case of an IO Exception. That is a small price compared to the convenience of maintaining the nested properties in a simple format.</p>\n<p>To conclude, if you need to replace <em>apache.commons.configuration</em>, you can either use Java’s <em>Properties</em> class, or decide on your own implementation — preferably use a data structure to handle your <em>.properties</em> file.\n<br />Each method has its own drawbacks.<br />\nUsing the <em>Properties</em> class will be most suitable for simple key-value pairs, while for nested data I’d recommend using a data structure where the key stores the main key, and the value will hold a <em>JsonNode</em> that will store the secondary keys and their values.</p>\n",
